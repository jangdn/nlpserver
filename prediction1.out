de bedrijfvereniging voor de metaalnijverheid a dutch lawyer moved to belgium while advising a client in a social security case , and was told he could not continue because dutch law said only people established in the netherlands could give legal advice . the court of justice held that the freedom to provide services applied , it was directly effective , and the rule was probably unjustified : having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice . the court of justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56 , because usually the state funds it , though higher education does not . health care generally counts as a service . in geraets-smits v stichting ziekenfonds mrs geraets-smits claimed she should be reimbursed by dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in germany . the dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary , so she argued this restricted the freedom
